# tl;dr
Tiny study of the fundamentals of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper). The code is an execution of the first segment of the tutorial presented on [this article](https://www.sitepoint.com/replace-redux-react-hooks-context-api).

I wanted to find out if it is possible to have a basic state management without the need of [Redux](https://redux.js.org) and the answer is yes, it is possible.


Of course React Hooks and Redux are not the same thing and by no means I intend to find a <i>replacement</i> for Redux, which is an insane (and complex) tool. I was just too lazy to study Redux to implement state management in a tiny project I am leading for React learning purposes.
